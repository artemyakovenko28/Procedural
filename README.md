# Procedural
Considered fundamental concepts of procedural programming, algorithms and data structures
## Tasks
### Sorts
`src/_0_sort` - Implemented BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort iteratively; MergeSort recursively
### Recursion
`src/_1_recursion` - Implemented recursively a function for finding factorial of a number and finding the Fibonacci numbers
### Dynamic data structures
`src/_2_dynamic_data_structures` - Implemented a singly-linked list and various operations on it iteratively and recursively:
1) creating and converting to a string
2) adding to the end, adding an index
3) delete from the end, delete by index
4) merging two lists
5) deep copying of the list
6) equality of two lists
7) finding the length of the list, its maximum element, the sum of all elements, checking for an increase
### Java reflection
`src/_4_reflect` - not procedural. Create an annotation for injecting a random integer value into class field. Implementation by Java Reflection API
### Algorithms
`src/_5_algorithms`
#### ArrayInverter
The array inverting algorithm (iteratively and recursively)
#### ArrayMerger
Merging of two sorted arrays
#### BinarySearch
Binary search algorithm
#### CircularPrimes
Find all circular primes up to 1 000 000. A circular prime is a prime number with the property that the number generated at each intermediate step when cyclically permuting its (base 10) digits will be prime.[1][2] For example, 1193 is a circular prime, since 1931, 9311 and 3119 all are also prime.
#### PalindromeChecker
Check if the string or number is a palindrome. Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or 123321
#### PrimeFinder
Find all prime numbers up to n.
#### PrimePalindrome
Program that returns the largest palindrome, which is a composition of two simple five-digit numbers, and returns the factors themselves. A simple number is a natural number that is divided entirely only by 1 and by itself (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...). A palindrome is a string, which is read equally in both directions (for example ABBA). Optimize program code so that calculations take less time.
#### CircularSequence
`src\_5_algorithms\CircularSequenceTask.java`<br>
Numbers from 1 to 999 are arranged in a circle (as on the clock face).
If you delete each 4th number, which three numbers will remain at the end?
#### Check for anagram two strings
`src\_5_algorithms\CheckForAnagramTwoStrings.java`<br>
Check for anagram two strings. Two string are anagram if we can get one string from another using permutations of letters
#### Sum of pairs
`src\_5_algorithms\SumOfPairs.java`<br>
Write an algorithm that detects all pairs of integers in the array, sum of which is equal to the specified value.
#### Find max product
`src\_5_algorithms\MaxProductFinder.java`<br>
Write a program that finds and prints max composition of 3 values in array of integers
